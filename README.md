# TheCoffeeMachine
A single-screen coffee ordering app inspired by an online course on Android App Development designed by Google and offered on Udacity. Added/modified some UI/functionalities independently.  The app lets the user type in their name,  choose quantity and preferences for their order, and displays the corresponding prices dynamically. Upon touching the Order button, the order summary is displayed with an option to send an email with the same details to a friend. Touching this button opens the default email app on the user's device (or asks the user which email app he/she desires to open in case of multiple email apps) with the order details pre-filled in the email body and the user simply needs to fill in the desired recipient's(s') name(s) and hit send.
